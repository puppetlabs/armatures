ARM-5: Structured Facts in Facter
==========================


Summary
-------

One of the oldest problems in Facter is enhancing the representation of fact 
values from simple strings to arbitrarily nested data structures. The most 
easily-accessible use case is enumerating network interfaces on a host:
these are currently separate facts with names of the form `interface_eth0`,
`interface_eth1`, etc., whose values are the "primary" IP address of that 
interface. With structured facts, this could be available in a much more 
natural and useful representation where the key is `interfaces`, its value is a 
hash keyed by interface name, whose leaf-node values are arrays of IP 
addresses. This enables powerful enumeration, searching, and usability in the 
Puppet DSL which is currently either clunky or impossible.

Goals
-----

This proposal aims to describe a possible implementation, mock up its usage, 
and think through the ramifications of the change to the larger Puppet 
ecosystem.

Non-Goals
---------

None specified at this time.

Success Metrics
---------------

Community concensus on the correct solution and an implementation path in the 
code.

Motivation
----------

* User pain: Representing non-string data in facter is currently painful. A 
  common request is for the right-hand-side value of a fact to be a simple list 
  of items; currently this requires putting some delimiter in the fact value 
  and then parsing it back out into an array in Puppet either through an inline 
  ERB template or a parser function like `split()` from stdlib.

* Competitive disadvantage: Facter's main competititor, ohai, has represented 
  data as a complex JSON data structure from the beginning.

Description
-----------

The proposal consists of several pieces (top-level bullet place-holders for 
now, further details to come)

* Facter itself might need new DSL syntax to create a structured fact
* The wire-format and console-output representation of facts might have to 
  change to present structured facts
* The affordances in the Puppet DSL for accessing structured facts vs legacy 
  facts might be different.
* Different/additional query syntax against PuppetDB or other fact storage
  terminii might be needed to indicate the 

Alternatives
------------

The main decision point is around how to represent facts once they're in the 
Puppet DSL. Currently all facts are available as top scope variables and are 
not differentiated from variables set at top scope. This is both convenient and 
problematic for users. On one hand, it's quite simple to refer to fact values 
in manifests and templates:

    # puppet DSL example
    if $operatingsystem == 'linux' {
      # do something
    } else {
      # do something else 
    }

    # erb example
    I'm running on <%= @operatingsystem -%> OS.

Problems arise when users create variable names that conflict with facts; this 
is especially troublesome because new facts can appear through modules 
distributed through pluginsync or facter updates and invalidate 
previously-acceptable manifests. There are two alternatives proposed for 
representing structured facts, both of which eliminate this ambiguity through 
different means.

1. Top-scope hash called `facts` which contains all of the structured facts as 
   keys.  This would clearly demarcate manifest and ENC-set variables from ones 
   that come from facter, provide a way to enumerate the facts (using the 
   `keys()` function on the hash), but have a cost of greater verbosity when 
   accessing its members. The above examples if this were supported would 
   become:

    # puppet dsl example
    if $facts['operatingsystem'] == 'linux' { ... }

    # erb example
    I'm running on <%= @facts['operatingsystem'] -%> OS.

2. Alternatively, structured fact names could exist as top-level variables as 
   they do now, but use a different sigil to the `$` for accessing them; for 
   example the `@` or `&` mark would indicate a separate namespace to manifest- 
   and ENC-set variables. The advantage of this is that it more compact and 
   saves a cost of the enclosing hash's name plus paired square brackets plus 
   paired apostrophes per invocation; the downside is that it requires an 
   alternate approach for templates since parsing there moves out of puppet's 
   control:

    # puppet dsl example
    if &operatingsystem == 'linux' { ... }

    # erb example -- must fallback to scope.lookupvar (?)
    I'm running on <%= scope.lookupvar('&operatingsystem') %>
