This repository contains Puppet Armatures, which are proposals to enhance / add features to Puppet or something in the Puppet
eco-system. This is a community-focused process intended to improve openness and transparency in both Puppet Labs-funded
and contributor efforts. For details, please read [ARM-0](arm-0.arm/index.md), which describes the rationale and process.
